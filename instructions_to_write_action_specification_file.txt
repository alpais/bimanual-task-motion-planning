The actions Specification file contains parameters for running the left and right arm

>> one per line
>> in this particular order:

----- >> Right Arm

# Motion parameters:
	r_pos_gain 			>> multiplier for the CDS master dynamics (i.e. the dynamical system controlling the position of the arm)
	r_ori_gain 			>> multiplier for the CDS slave dynamics
	r_err_gain 			>> speed multiplier for CDS (see detailed escription in the CDSExecution package)

	r_filter_gain_Wn 		>> gain for the CDDynamics filtering the arm motion

	r_masterType 			>> specifying the master type for CDS. 
					Possible values. 
						1 - MODEL_DYNAMICS
						2 - LINEAR_DYNAMICS
						3 - NO_DYNAMICS
					Default value: 1 - MODEL_DYNAMICS

	r_slaveType 			>> slave type for CDS 
					Possible values 
						1 - MODEL_DYNAMICS
						2 - LINEAR_DYNAMICS
						3 - NO_DYNAMICS
						4 - UTHETA
					Default value: 4 - UTHETA

	r_avg_jstiff 			>> specify average stiffness if not running model based stiffness
					otherwise acts as bounding value for the model estimated stiffness

# Force parameters
	bUseForce_r_arm 		>> 1 if arm should apply a force
	bEnableForceModel_r_arm 	>> 1 if force comes from model

	bEndInContact_r_arm 		>> 1 if arm in contact at the end of the action 
					(e.g. a reaching action can end in contact, but a manipulation action can require force but end in contact 
					if a second force action follows, or not)

	search_axis_r_arm 		>> direction to search for contact

	max_task_force_r_arm    	>> acts as default value if a model is not specified, 
					otherwise acts as bounding value for the model estimated force

	max_search_distance_r_arm  	>> safety parameter, arm goes down on the specified axis, looking for a contact. 
					If no contact found within search distance, it stops

	max_vertical_speed_r_arm   	>> safety parameter, arm goes down with specified speed. 	
					Use low values if contact should be done with rather soft objects 
					(i.e. zuchinni ends in contact with the table)

	max_contact_force_r_arm    	>> safety parameter, arm stops when this contact force is established. Typically this comes from demonstration. 

----- >> Left Arm

### same as above

---- >> General parameters

bActionTypeReach 			>> 1 if it is a pure reaching action, no contacts whatsoever
					used to bias the FT sensors, at the begining of each reaching action

bAdditionalTransforms 			>> 1 if the RF in which the models were learned was different than the RF in which the robot is moving
